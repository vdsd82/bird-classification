## Where to Find American Coots

American coots can be found in a variety of freshwater habitats throughout North America, including marshes, ponds, lakes, and rivers. They are most commonly found in the western United States and Canada, but can also be found in the eastern and southern regions of the continent.

## Diet

The American coot is primarily herbivorous, feeding on aquatic vegetation such as algae, grasses, and sedges. They also consume small aquatic animals, such as insects, snails, and small fish. Coots are known for their unique feeding behavior, in which they dive underwater to feed on aquatic plants and animals.

## Breeding and Nesting

American coots are monogamous, meaning they mate with only one partner during breeding season. Breeding season typically occurs from March to August. The coot builds a floating nest made of aquatic vegetation in shallow water near the shore. The female lays 8-12 eggs, which both parents incubate for approximately 21-25 days. Once hatched, the chicks are able to swim and feed themselves within hours.
