It has a long, slender bill that is slightly curved at the tip, and its feet are webbed for efficient swimming.

## Habitat

The Auckland Shag is found only in the Hauraki Gulf, a body of water that lies between the Coromandel Peninsula and the city of Auckland in New Zealand. These birds prefer to nest on rocky cliffs and islands close to the shore and spend most of their time foraging in the shallow waters of the gulf.

## Diet

The Auckland Shag is a carnivore and feeds primarily on small fish, squid, and crustaceans. These birds hunt by diving into the water from the surface and using their webbed feet to swim after their prey. They can stay underwater for up to 2 minutes and dive to depths of up to 20 meters.

## Breeding and Nesting

The breeding season for Auckland Shags begins in late winter and lasts until early summer. These birds mate for life and typically lay 2-3 eggs per season. The eggs are incubated for around 30 days, and the chicks fledge after 60-70 days. During this time, the parents take turns caring for the young and feeding them regurgitated fish.
