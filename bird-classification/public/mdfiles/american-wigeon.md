They are migratory birds, with their breeding grounds located in the northern parts of North America, including Alaska and Canada. During the winter months, they can be found in the southern parts of the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

## Diet

The American Wigeon is an omnivorous duck, with a diet that consists of both plant and animal matter. Their diet includes aquatic plants, seeds, insects, and small crustaceans. They are known to forage on land as well as in shallow water, and they use their bills to sift through the mud and water to find food.
