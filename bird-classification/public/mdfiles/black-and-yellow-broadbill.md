The Black and Yellow Broadbill, also known as the Eurylaimus ochromalus, is a passerine bird that belongs to the family Calyptomenidae. This species of bird is native to the forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia.

## **Physical Characteristics**

The Black and Yellow Broadbill is a small bird that measures about 17 centimeters in length and weighs about 20 grams. Its most striking physical feature is its unique coloration, with a combination of black and bright yellow plumage that makes it stand out in its habitat.

Its wings and tail feathers are also black, with a blue-green sheen visible in good light.

## **Where to Find**

The Black and Yellow Broadbill is typically found in the dense undergrowth of lowland and montane forests, making it a challenging bird to spot for many birdwatchers. They can be found in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia, with a range that extends from the foothills of the Himalayas to the southern part of Thailand. They prefer to reside in areas with moist soil and abundant vegetation, particularly in bamboo and mangrove forests.

These birds are also known to consume small fruits and berries, especially during the breeding season when they require additional nutrients to nourish their young.

## **Breeding and Nesting**

The Black and Yellow Broadbill is known for its unique breeding and nesting behavior. They form monogamous pairs and build their nests using plant fibers, moss, and spider webs, which they attach to the underside of a large leaf. They lay a clutch of two to three eggs, which both parents incubate for around 18 to 20 days. The chicks are born naked and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and protection until they are ready to leave the nest after around 20 days.

## **Conservation Status**

The Black and Yellow Broadbill is classified as a species of "least concern" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, like many other bird species, its population is declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation and agricultural expansion. As such, conservationists are urging authorities to implement measures to protect the forests where these birds reside.
