## Physical Characteristics

The ANTBIRD is a small to medium-sized bird, measuring between 10 to 20 centimeters in length. These birds have a unique appearance, with males and females differing in coloration. The males are typically black or dark gray with contrasting white markings, while females are reddish-brown with streaked underparts.

## Where ANTBIRD Can Be Found

ANTBIRDs are found throughout Central and South America, with different species inhabiting various regions. Some species, such as the Black-faced ANTBIRD, are found primarily in the Amazon Basin, while others, such as the Dusky ANTBIRD, can be found in both Central and South America.

## Diet

As the name suggests, ANTBIRDs primarily feed on ants, as well as other insects and arthropods. They have specialized bills that are designed to help them capture and eat these small prey items. ANTBIRDs are known to follow army ant swarms, which flush out insects, making them easier to capture.

## Breeding and Nesting Habits

ANTBIRDs are monogamous, with males and females forming pairs during the breeding season. They build their nests on the ground or in low vegetation, typically using twigs and other plant material. Females lay one to three eggs, which they incubate for approximately 15 to 20 days. Once the chicks hatch, both parents are involved in feeding and caring for them.
