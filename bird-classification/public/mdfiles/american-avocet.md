AMERICAN AVOCET
---
The American Avocet, scientific name Recurvirostra americana, is a striking shorebird that belongs to the avocet and stilts family. These birds are known for their unique and elegant appearance, with their long, slender legs and curved bills. In this article, we will explore the physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding and nesting habits, conservation status, interesting facts, and related species of the American Avocet.

## Physical Characteristics:
The American Avocet is a medium-sized bird that measures around 16-19 inches in length, with a wingspan of 27-30 inches. They have long, thin legs that are blue-gray in color and a long, curved bill that is black and white. Their distinctive plumage is white on the underbelly and neck, with black and white feathers on the back and wings. During breeding season, they develop rusty-red feathers on their heads and necks.

## Where to Find Them:
The American Avocet is primarily found in the western part of North America, from Alaska to Mexico. They prefer shallow, brackish wetlands, such as salt flats, mudflats, and shallow ponds, and are often found in areas with emergent vegetation.

## Diet:
The American Avocet is a wading bird that primarily feeds on small aquatic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insects, and mollusks. They forage by sweeping their bills from side to side in shallow water, using their sensitive bills to detect prey.

## Breeding and Nesting:
During breeding season, American Avocets form monogamous pairs and build their nests on the ground near shallow water. The female typically lays three to four eggs, which both parents take turns incubating for around 22-23 days. Once the chicks hatch, they are precocial, which means they are able to leave the nest and feed themselves shortly after hatching.

## Conservation Status:
The American Avocet is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, they are still threatened by habitat loss, disturbance from human activity, and pollution. Efforts are being made to protect their breeding grounds and restore wetland habitats where they live.

## Interesting Facts:

The American Avocet has one of the longest legs in proportion to its body size of any bird species.
They are known for their unique foraging behavior of sweeping their bills from side to side in shallow water, stirring up prey.
American Avocets are migratory, with some populations traveling thousands of miles each year.
They have a unique and melodious call that sounds like a high-pitched "kwip."

## Related Species:
The American Avocet is closely related to other species of avocets and stilts, including the Black-necked Stilt and the Pied Avocet. These birds share similar physical characteristics and behaviors, but each has its own distinct range and habitat preferences.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the American Avocet is a beautiful and fascinating bird that can be found in the wetlands of western North America. Their unique physical characteristics, foraging behavior, and breeding habits make them a unique species to observe and study. While their conservation status is currently stable, continued efforts are needed to protect their habitats and ensure their survival for generations to come.
