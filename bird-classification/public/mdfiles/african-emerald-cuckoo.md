## Physical Characteristics

The African Emerald Cuckoo is a small bird, measuring around 16-18 centimeters in length. The male and female of this species have different physical characteristics, with the male having a more vibrant green plumage than the female. The male has a glossy green upper body, while the female's is a duller green with a brownish-grey throat. Both genders have a slender body with a long tail that is tipped with white.

In addition to their striking green color, the African Emerald Cuckoo has a distinctive call that can be heard throughout their habitat. Their call is a series of high-pitched whistles that sound like "kee-kee-kee" or "swee-swee-swee". This call is often heard during breeding season, as the male tries to attract a mate.

Their diet consists primarily of insects, but they have also been known to eat fruit and small reptiles.

One interesting behavior of the African Emerald Cuckoo is their courtship display. During breeding season, the male will puff up his feathers and spread his wings while emitting a series of calls. This display is used to attract a female and can be seen as a way of advertising his fitness as a mate.
