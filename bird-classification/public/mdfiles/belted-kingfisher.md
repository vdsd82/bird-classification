## Introduction

The Belted Kingfisher is a fascinating bird known for its unique appearance and behavior. Its scientific name is Megaceryle alcyon, and it is a member of the Cerylidae family. The Belted Kingfisher can be found throughout North and Central America, and it is well-known for its diving abilities and its distinct call.

## Physical Characteristics

The Belted Kingfisher is a medium-sized bird, with a length of approximately 28cm and a wingspan of 48-58cm. Its head is large and features a shaggy crest, and its bill is long, straight and sharp. The male and female Belted Kingfishers are very similar in appearance, but the female can be distinguished by the rusty-brown band across its breast.

## Where to Find

The Belted Kingfisher can be found near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. It prefers freshwater habitats, but can also be found in brackish and saltwater environments. Belted Kingfishers are also known to frequent man-made structures such as bridges and piers.

## Diet

Belted Kingfishers are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, although they will also eat crayfish, insects, and other small aquatic animals. They hunt by perching on a high branch or structure and then diving into the water to catch their prey. They have a special adaptation that allows them to see clearly underwater, and their sharp bill helps them to grasp and hold onto their prey.

## Breeding and Nesting

Belted Kingfishers are monogamous and typically mate for life. They build their nests in burrows along riverbanks, usually excavating a hole in a dirt bank. The female lays 5-8 eggs, which both parents take turns incubating for about three weeks. The young are born blind and helpless, and both parents work together to feed and care for them until they fledge at around four weeks of age.

The Belted Kingfisher is not considered to be a species of concern, with a population of approximately 2 million individuals. However, they can be affected by habitat loss and pollution, so conservation efforts are important to ensure their continued survival.
