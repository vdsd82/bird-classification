## Physical Characteristics
Alpine choughs, also known as yellow-billed choughs, are a type of bird that belongs to the crow family. They have black feathers that are iridescent in the sunlight, and a distinctive curved yellow beak. Their wingspan ranges from 84-94 cm, and they can weigh up to 270 grams. They have a unique tail, which is square at the tip and deeply forked. These physical characteristics make Alpine choughs easily recognizable and distinguishable from other bird species.

## Where to Find Alpine Choughs
Alpine choughs are commonly found in the high mountains of Europe and Asia, specifically in the Alps, Pyrenees, and the Himalayas. They prefer rocky terrain and can be seen flying or hopping along cliffs and steep mountain slopes.

## Diet of Alpine Choughs
Alpine choughs are omnivorous and feed on a wide variety of foods. They primarily eat insects, small mammals, and carrion, but they also consume berries and seeds when available. They are known to follow herds of grazing animals to feed on insects disturbed by their movement.

## Breeding and Nesting
Alpine choughs typically breed in the months of May to July. They build their nests in rocky crevices, caves, or on ledges, often at high altitudes. Females lay 3-5 eggs, which are incubated for about 17-20 days. Both parents take care of the eggs and chicks until they are ready to leave the nest, which usually happens after 30-40 days.

## Conservation Status
Alpine choughs are considered to be a species of "Least Concern" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, their populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, and their distribution is becoming increasingly fragmented. It is important to protect their habitat and monitor their populations to ensure their survival.

## Interesting Facts
Alpine choughs are social birds and often form large flocks. They have been observed playing with objects and even sliding down snow banks for fun. They have a unique way of communicating with each other using various calls and vocalizations. In some cultures, they are considered to be a symbol of good luck.

## Related Species
