## Physical Characteristics

Burchell's courser (Cursorius rufus) is a medium-sized bird that belongs to the Glareolidae family. It has a distinctive appearance with a long, slender neck, a small head, and long legs. The body is covered with sandy-brown feathers with dark patches on the back, wings, and tail. The beak is short and curved, and the eyes are large and brown. The bird's size ranges from 20-24 cm (8-9.5 in) in length, and it weighs around 70-80 g (2.5-2.8 oz).

## Where to Find

Burchell's courser is mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the savannah and scrubland areas of South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Angola. The bird prefers to live in arid or semi-arid habitats with sandy or rocky soils, low vegetation, and scattered trees. It is an active bird that is mostly seen on the ground, often in pairs or small groups.

## Diet

Burchell's courser feeds primarily on insects, such as beetles, ants, termites, and grasshoppers. It also feeds on small reptiles, such as lizards and geckos. The bird is diurnal, meaning it is most active during the day, foraging for food by running along the ground in short bursts.

## Breeding and Nesting

Burchell's courser breeds during the rainy season, which varies depending on the region. The bird's courtship display involves chasing each other, spreading their wings and tails, and making a whistling sound. The female lays two eggs in a shallow scrape in the ground, often near a rock or bush. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 20-25 days, and the chicks fledge after about 20-25 days.

## Conservation Status

Burchell's courser is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although the bird's population has not been accurately estimated, it is believed to be stable, and the species is not currently facing any major threats. However, habitat loss due to human activities, such as agriculture and urbanization, could pose a threat to the bird's future survival.

## Interesting Facts

-   Burchell's courser is named after the British naturalist William John Burchell, who discovered the bird during his travels in southern Africa in the early 19th century.
-   The bird has a unique way of protecting itself from predators by using the "broken-wing" display. When threatened, the bird pretends to have a broken wing and hops away from the nest, attracting the predator's attention away from the chicks.
-   Burchell's courser is known for its fast running speed, which can reach up to 24 km/h (15 mph).
-   The bird is also known for its loud and melodious call, which sounds like a whistling or chirping sound.

## Related Species

Burchell's courser is closely related to other courser species, such as the cream-coloured courser, the temminck's courser, and the Somali courser. These birds share similar physical characteristics and habits, but they have subtle differences in their plumage and distribution. Temminck's courser, for example, has a distinctive black and white head pattern and is found in the grasslands and deserts of sub-Saharan Africa. The cream-coloured courser, on the other hand, has a cream-colored plumage with a distinctive black mask and is found in the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.

## Conclusion

Burchell's courser is a fascinating bird species that is known for its unique physical characteristics, habitat, and habits. This bird is a joy to watch in the wild, as it scurries along the ground in search of food, and its courtship display is a beautiful sight to behold. Although it is not currently facing any major threats, it is important to conserve the bird's habitat to ensure its continued survival in the wild.
