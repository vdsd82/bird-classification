Its black and white plumage, long thin legs, and distinctive red eyes make it easily recognizable. These shorebirds are found in many regions of the Americas, from Canada to Chile, and are known for their adaptability and resilience in a variety of habitats.

These legs are perfectly adapted for wading in shallow water and navigating through marshy habitats.

## Where to Find
