The Black-throated Sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata) is a small, ground-dwelling bird native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. This bird is known for its striking black-and-white head pattern and distinctive call. In this article, we will explore the physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding and nesting, conservation status, interesting facts, and related species of the Black-throated Sparrow.

## Physical Characteristics

The Black-throated Sparrow is a small bird, measuring about 5-6 inches in length and weighing around 0.5-0.7 ounces. It has a distinctive black-and-white head pattern, with a black throat and face, white forehead, and white eye stripe. The body is brownish-gray, and the wings and tail have brownish-black stripes. The beak is short and conical, and the legs are pinkish-gray.

## Where to Find

The Black-throated Sparrow can be found in arid and semi-arid habitats, including desert scrub, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Its range extends from the southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas and California) to northwestern Mexico.

## Diet

The Black-throated Sparrow is primarily granivorous, feeding on a variety of seeds and grains, including grasses, shrubs, and cacti. It may also eat insects and spiders, especially during the breeding season. This bird has a unique feeding behavior, where it picks up seeds with its beak and tosses them into the air to catch and eat them.

## Breeding and Nesting

The breeding season for Black-throated Sparrows typically occurs from March to July. The male establishes a territory and attracts a mate through a series of courtship displays, including singing, wing-fluttering, and tail-spreading. The female builds a cup-shaped nest from grasses and twigs, usually in a shrub or low tree. The female lays 2-4 eggs, which she incubates for about 12-14 days. The young fledge after about 11-14 days and may remain with the parents for several weeks.

## Conservation Status

The Black-throated Sparrow is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, habitat loss and degradation due to urbanization, agriculture, and livestock grazing can pose a threat to its population.

## Interesting Facts

-   The Black-throated Sparrow is known for its distinctive call, which sounds like a high-pitched "tinkling" or "spinning coin".
-   This bird is a ground-dwelling species and rarely flies more than a few feet above the ground.
-   Black-throated Sparrows are known to form large flocks outside of the breeding season, sometimes consisting of hundreds of individuals.
-   This bird has a unique "dust-bathing" behavior, where it lies on its side and flaps its wings to create a small depression in the ground, then rolls in the dust to clean its feathers.

## Related Species

The Black-throated Sparrow is part of the Emberizidae family, which includes a diverse group of birds, including towhees, juncos, and buntings. Other sparrow species that share a similar habitat and range as the Black-throated Sparrow include the Sagebrush Sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis) and the Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri).

## Conclusion

The Black-throated Sparrow is a unique and fascinating bird that has adapted to the arid and semi-arid habitats of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Its distinctive black-and-white head pattern and unique feeding behavior make it a fascinating bird to observe in the wild. While it is currently classified as a species of least concern, it is important to be mindful of the threats to its habitat and population, and to work towards conservation efforts to ensure its survival for future generations to enjoy.
