With its striking plumage and distinctive crown of feathers, this bird is a true marvel of nature. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the African crowned crane, exploring its physical characteristics, habitat, and behavior.

## Physical Characteristics

The African crowned crane (Balearica regulorum) is a large bird that stands at around 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of up to 6 feet. Its most distinctive feature is the crown of golden feathers on its head, which gives it its name. The rest of its plumage is a mixture of black, white, and gray, with long, thin legs that are ideal for wading through shallow water.

One of the most impressive things about the African crowned crane is its courtship display. During mating season, the males will dance and jump around while fluffing up their feathers and spreading their wings to show off their beautiful plumage. This display is truly a sight to behold and is a clear indication of the bird's vitality and health.

## Where to Find the African Crowned Crane

The African crowned crane is found throughout the grasslands and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. They are also found in parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.

## Habitat

The African crowned crane prefers open grasslands and savannas, where it can forage for insects, small animals, and plant matter. They are also known to wade in shallow water, where they can catch fish and other aquatic creatures. These birds are highly adaptable and can survive in a variety of habitats, from wetlands to dry savannas.

## Behavior

The African crowned crane is a social bird that lives in small flocks of up to 10 individuals. They are highly territorial and will defend their nesting sites aggressively against intruders. During the breeding season, the males will build a nest of grass and sticks on the ground, which the female will then line with feathers and other soft materials. The female will lay between 2 and 5 eggs, which both parents will take turns incubating for around 30 days.
