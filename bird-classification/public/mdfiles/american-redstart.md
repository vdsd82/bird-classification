During the breeding season, they can be found in deciduous and mixed forests, where they prefer the edges of the forest and the understory. During the winter, they inhabit tropical forests, mangroves, and other wooded habitats in Central and South America.

## Diet

## Breeding and Nesting

The American Redstart breeds in North America from May to July. Males arrive at breeding grounds before females and establish territories by singing and performing flight displays. Females build the nests, which are cup-shaped and made of grasses, twigs, and bark. They lay 3-5 eggs per clutch and incubate them for 10-13 days. Both parents care for the young, which fledge after 8-10 days.
