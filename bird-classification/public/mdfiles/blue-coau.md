---

Blue Coau (Cyanopsitta spixii) is a rare and beautiful bird that is native to Brazil. It is also known as Spix's Macaw or Little Blue Macaw. The Blue Coau is one of the most endangered parrots in the world, with only a few dozen left in the wild. In this article, we will explore the physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding and nesting habits, conservation status, interesting facts, and related species of this unique bird.

## Physical Characteristics

The Blue Coau is a small, brightly colored bird that measures about 55 cm in length and weighs around 300 grams. It has a striking blue plumage, with a light blue head and neck, a darker blue back and wings, and a pale blue underbelly. The wingspan of the Blue Coau is approximately 90 cm.

## Where to Find

The Blue Coau is found only in a small area in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Bahia and Alagoas. Its natural habitat is the Caatinga dry forest, where it feeds on the fruits of the licuri palm tree. Due to habitat loss, hunting, and capture for the pet trade, the Blue Coau is now critically endangered.

## Diet

The Blue Coau is primarily a frugivorous bird, feeding mainly on the fruits of the licuri palm tree. It also eats flowers, seeds, and leaves. The Blue Coau is known to be a fussy eater and prefers only a few specific types of fruits. Its diet in captivity includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

## Breeding and Nesting

The Blue Coau is monogamous and mates for life. Breeding usually occurs during the rainy season from November to April. The female lays two to three eggs in a tree cavity, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The chicks fledge after about 90 days and become independent after six months.

## Conservation Status

The Blue Coau is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Its population has declined dramatically due to habitat loss, hunting, and capture for the pet trade. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining wild populations and establish captive breeding programs to ensure the survival of the species.

## Interesting Facts
