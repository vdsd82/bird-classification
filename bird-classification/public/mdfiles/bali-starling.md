Bali Starling: The Exquisite and Endangered Bird Species
---

The Bali Starling (Leucopsar rothschildi), also known as Rothschild's Mynah or Bali Mynah, is a remarkable bird species endemic to the island of Bali in Indonesia. This stunning bird has captured the attention of bird enthusiasts worldwide with its snowy-white plumage and striking blue eye-ring. Unfortunately, this bird is also one of the world's rarest birds, and it is critically endangered. In this article, we will discuss the Bali Starling's physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding and nesting habits, conservation status, and interesting facts.

## Physical Characteristics

The Bali Starling is a medium-sized bird that measures approximately 25-30 cm in length and weighs around 130-180 grams. Its feathers are predominantly white, with a distinctive blue eye-ring, black tips on its wings and tail, and a bright yellow bill. The male and female birds look similar, although the male may have a slightly larger eye-ring.

## Where to Find

The Bali Starling is endemic to the Indonesian island of Bali, where it inhabits dry and open forests. Specifically, it is found in the western part of the island, in the Bali Barat National Park and the surrounding areas.

## Diet

The Bali Starling's diet consists mainly of fruits, seeds, and insects. In the wild, it feeds on figs, papayas, guavas, and other tropical fruits. It also feeds on insects, including crickets, beetles, and caterpillars.

## Breeding and Nesting

The Bali Starling breeds from July to September. The male Bali Starling performs an elaborate courtship dance to attract a mate. The pair then builds a nest in a tree hollow or in the fork of a tree. The female lays two to three eggs, which are incubated for approximately 14 days. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge after 30 days.

## Conservation Status

The Bali Starling is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The main threat to the Bali Starling is habitat loss due to deforestation, mining, and agricultural activities. Additionally, illegal poaching and trapping for the pet trade have severely depleted the Bali Starling's population.

Efforts to save the Bali Starling from extinction include captive breeding programs, habitat restoration, and anti-poaching measures. Bali Barat National Park, where most of the Bali Starlings are found, has been designated a protected area to safeguard the Bali Starling and other endemic species.

## Interesting Facts

-   The Bali Starling is also known as the "Jalak Bali" in the local language.
-   The Bali Starling's scientific name, Leucopsar rothschildi, honors the British banker and naturalist Walter Rothschild, who funded the expedition that discovered the bird in 1910.
-   The Bali Starling is not the only species of starling found in Bali. Other species of starling found on the island include the Chestnut-winged Starling, the Black-winged Starling, and the White-shouldered Starling.

## Conclusion

The Bali Starling is an extraordinary and beautiful bird species that is sadly on the brink of extinction. The Bali Starling's unique physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding
and nesting habits, conservation status, and interesting facts make it a fascinating subject for bird enthusiasts and conservationists alike. It is crucial that we take action to protect this species and prevent its extinction.
