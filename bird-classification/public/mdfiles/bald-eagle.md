Bald Eagle: A Majestic Bird of Prey
---

The bald eagle, also known as Haliaeetus leucocephalus, is a bird of prey that is native to North America. It is known for its majestic appearance, which has made it a symbol of strength and freedom in the United States. In this article, we will explore the physical characteristics of the bald eagle, its habitat, diet, breeding and nesting habits, conservation status, interesting facts, and related species.

## Physical Characteristics

The bald eagle is a large bird with a wingspan of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters). It has a white head and tail, and a brown body. Its eyes are yellow and its beak is hooked and yellow as well. Bald eagles have powerful talons that are used for hunting prey. Juvenile bald eagles have dark feathers on their head and tail and mottled brown and white feathers on their body.

## Where to Find

Bald eagles are found throughout North America, from Alaska and Canada to the northern parts of Mexico. They can be found near large bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and coasts, as they feed primarily on fish.

## Diet

The bald eagle is a carnivore and feeds primarily on fish. They also hunt for small mammals, waterfowl, and carrion. Bald eagles have a unique hunting style, where they fly low over the water and snatch fish from the surface with their talons.

## Breeding and Nesting

Bald eagles mate for life and build large nests high in trees near water. They add to their nests each year, and can grow to be over 13 feet (4 meters) deep and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. Bald eagles lay 1-3 eggs per year, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs for about 35 days. After hatching, the eaglets are cared for by both parents and can fly at about 12 weeks old.

## Conservation Status

The bald eagle was once listed as an endangered species due to habitat destruction, hunting, and the use of pesticides. However, due to conservation efforts, the bald eagle population has rebounded and it was removed from the endangered species list in 2007. It is now listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

## Interesting Facts

-   The bald eagle is not actually bald. It gets its name from the white feathers on its head that resemble a bald head.
-   Bald eagles can see up to four times farther than humans.
-   The largest bald eagle nest ever recorded was found in St. Petersburg, Florida and measured 9.5 feet (2.9 meters) wide and 20 feet (6 meters) deep.
-   The bald eagle is the national bird and symbol of the United States.

## Related Species

The bald eagle is a member of the sea and fish eagle family. Other species in this family include the African fish eagle, white-tailed eagle, and Steller's sea eagle.

## Conclusion

The bald eagle is a majestic bird of prey that has become an important symbol of strength and freedom in the United States. It is known for its striking appearance, unique hunting style, and impressive nests. While the bald eagle was once endangered, conservation efforts have helped to increase its population and it is now a species of least concern. With its powerful presence and important role in American culture, the bald eagle will continue to be a beloved and admired species for generations to come.
