---

## Introduction

The Hawaiian Black-Hooded Tern, also known as the Anianiau, is a small bird species that can only be found in Hawaii. In this article, we will delve into the physical characteristics, habitat, diet, breeding and nesting habits, conservation status, interesting facts, and related species of this beautiful bird.

## Physical Characteristics

The Anianiau is a small bird, measuring about 4.5 inches in length and weighing only around 0.4 ounces. Its most distinguishing feature is its black hood that covers its head, with a white patch on its forehead. Its back and wings are black, while its underparts are white. The bill and legs of the Anianiau are black as well.

## Where to Find Anianiau

The Anianiau is endemic to Hawaii, specifically on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui. These birds can be found in high elevation forests, particularly in the areas dominated by koa and ohia trees.

## Diet

The Anianiau feeds mainly on insects, particularly caterpillars, spiders, and moths. They also eat nectar from the flowers of the ohia trees, which is their primary source of hydration.

## Breeding and Nesting

The breeding season for Anianiau is from April to July. During this time, the male birds perform an elaborate courtship display to attract females. The female then constructs a small, cup-shaped nest made of moss, lichen, and twigs, which is usually situated on the branch of a tree. The female lays only one egg, which both parents take turns incubating. After about two weeks, the egg hatches, and the parents continue to take turns feeding and caring for the chick.

## Conservation Status

Unfortunately, the Anianiau is currently listed as an endangered species. Its population has significantly declined due to habitat loss caused by deforestation, wildfires, and invasive species like rats and mongoose. Conservation efforts are currently underway to protect and restore the habitats of the Anianiau.

## Interesting Facts

-   The Anianiau has a unique call that sounds like "see-see-see-see-sew."
-   Despite their small size, these birds can fly for long distances, even crossing open water.
-   The Anianiau is also known as the "Hawaiian honeycreeper," which is a term used to describe a group of small, colorful birds endemic to Hawaii.

## Related Species

The Anianiau is part of the Drepanidinae subfamily, which is a group of small birds endemic to Hawaii. Some of the related species include the Akepa, Akohekohe, and Maui Parrotbill.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Anianiau is a fascinating bird species that is unique to Hawaii. Their striking black hood and small size make them easy to spot in the high elevation forests of Kauai, Oahu, and Maui. Despite being endangered, conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore their habitats, ensuring that future generations can appreciate their beauty and importance in the ecosystem.
