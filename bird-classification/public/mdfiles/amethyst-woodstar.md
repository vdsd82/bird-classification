## Where Amethyst Woodstar is Found

The Amethyst Woodstar is primarily found in the tropical and subtropical forests of South America, including Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. They are also found in the mountainous regions of these countries at elevations up to 3,000 meters. These birds prefer to live in humid forest areas near rivers, streams, and other water sources.

## Diet
