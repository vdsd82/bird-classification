It has black feathers and a bright red beak, with a distinctive white patch on its forehead. The male and female Black Swans look very similar, but the male is usually slightly larger.

## Where to Find Black Swans

Black Swans are native to Australia and are found in many different habitats, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands. They are also found in urban areas such as parks and gardens, where they have been introduced as an ornamental bird.

## Diet

Black Swans are herbivores and feed on a variety of aquatic plants, such as waterweed, duckweed, and algae. They also eat grasses and grains, and sometimes insects and small aquatic animals. They have a unique way of feeding, known as "tipping", where they upend their bodies and dip their heads underwater to feed on submerged plants.

## Breeding and Nesting

Black Swans form lifelong partnerships and breed during the spring and summer months. They build large nests made of reeds and grasses in shallow water, and both parents take turns incubating the eggs. The eggs hatch after about 35 days, and the young cygnets are cared for by both parents until they are able to fly.
