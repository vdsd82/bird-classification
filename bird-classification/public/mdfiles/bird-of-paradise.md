## Physical Characteristics

Bird of Paradise is known for its striking appearance, which includes an array of vibrant colors and intricate patterns on their feathers. These birds are relatively small, ranging from 15 to 45 cm in length, and they weigh anywhere from 50 to 430 grams, depending on the species.
